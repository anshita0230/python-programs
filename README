# 💰 Expense Tracker (Python + JSON + Generators)

A simple **Expense Tracker** built in Python using:
- **JSON** for data storage  
- **Generators** for memory-efficient data handling  
- **File Handling** to save and read expenses

This project lets you **add**, **list**, and **filter** expenses directly from the terminal.

## 🚀 Features
- Add expenses with name, note, and amount
- Save all data in a `JSON` file
- List all expenses in a clean format
- Filter expenses by a minimum amount
- Uses **Python generators** for efficient data iteration

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. When you add an expense, it is saved in `expense.json`.
2. The data is loaded whenever you run the program.
3. Generators (`yield`) are used to read expenses one by one instead of loading all into memory at once.
4. You can filter expenses by setting a minimum amount.
